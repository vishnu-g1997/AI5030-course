Question 53) Suppose (X,Y) follows bivariate normal distribution with means $\mu1  \mu2$, standard deviations $\sigma1$,$\sigma2$ and correlation coefficient $\rho$, where all parameters are un-known. Then, testing Ho: $\sigma1=\sigma2$ is equivalent to testing the independence of  
\\
1.) X and Y \\
2.) X and X-Y \\
3.) X+Y and Y \\
4.) X+Y and X-Y \\

Answer: 4, X+Y and X-Y \\
Solution:
Given X and Y are bi-variate random variables.  Bivariate random variables are distribution of normal distribution to two coordinates. If any two random variables, $ X_1 and X_2$ are said independent, then it follows that the co-relation co-efficient $\rho[X_1,X_2]$ is equal to 0. \smallskip

\begin{equation*}
\rho[X_1,X_2]  = 0
\end{equation*}

We know that, for a bi-variate random variable correlation is given as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \rho[X,Y] = \frac{\sigma_[X,Y] } {\sqrt{\sigma_[X]^2 \times \sigma_[Y]^2}}
\end{equation*}


For for testing independence of $[X+Y, X-Y]$, we need to see if  $\rho[X+Y,X-Y]$ becomes 0.\\
if  $\rho[X+Y,X-Y]$  = 0, then it follows from the bivariate random distribution that $\sigma_{[X+Y,X-Y]}$ equates to 0\\
\\
We know that
\\
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{[X+Y,Z]} &= \sigma_{[X,Z]} + \sigma_{[Y,Z]} \\
  \sigma_{[X,X]} &= \sigma_{[X]}^2 
\end{align}
Testing for the independence of X,Y\\
$\sigma_{[X,Y]}$ is always not equal to 0 when $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$.\\
Also if $\sigma_{[X,Y]}$ is equal to 0, it means that XY are in the form of\\
$Y = C\times X$ or $Y=X^2$ or any $Y = f(X)$, which means both of them are dependent.
So, $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ does not imply X,Y are in-dependant.\\

Testing independence of X,X-Y\\
\begin{align*}
    \sigma_{[X-Y,X]} &= \sigma_{[X,X]} - \sigma_{[X,Y]}\\
                     &= \sigma_{X}^2 - \sigma_{[X,Y]}
\end{align*}
$\sigma_{X}^2 \neq \sigma_{[X,Y]}$ which $\implies$ X,X-Y are not independent\\

Testing for independence of X,X+Y\\
\begin{align*}
    \sigma_{[X+Y,X]} &= \sigma_{[X,X]} + \sigma_{[X,Y]}\\
                     &= \sigma_{X}^2 + \sigma_{[X,Y]}
\end{align*}
$\sigma_{X}^2 \neq -\sigma_{[X,Y]}$ which $\implies$ X,X-Y are not independent\\

Testing for independance of X+Y,X-Y
\begin{align*}
& \hspace{5pt}COV[X+Y, X-Y]\\
&= COV[(X+Y), X] - COV[(X+Y), Y] \\
&= COV[(X,X)] + COV[X,Y] - COV[X,Y] - COV[Y,Y] \\
&= Var[X] - Var[Y]\\
\end{align*}

Now testing for $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 $ $\implies$ \\ $COV[X+Y,X-Y] = 0 $ $\Rightarrow$ $\rho[X+Y,X-Y]$ =  0\\
Hence testing for   $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 \implies X+Y, X-Y$ are independent.
